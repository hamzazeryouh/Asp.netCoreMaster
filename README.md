Branch Feature/DependencyInjection I Explan Dependency injection (DI) :
Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern in .NET Core that allows for the loose coupling of objects and their dependencies. The purpose of DI is to allow for easier testing and maintenance of code, by making it possible to swap out dependencies without affecting the rest of the application. This is accomplished by the DI container managing the creation and wiring of objects and their dependencies, rather than having the objects themselves manage this. With DI, classes can be designed in a more modular and flexible manner, making it easier to change the implementation of a component without affecting the rest of the application.
